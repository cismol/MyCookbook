<h3>Looking For Something?</h3>
<p>Today, I looked, and saw, and noticed.

Today, I searced, and began to seek,
That new thing.

I never know what it is or where it will be.

Forever, I will be seeking that special thing,
something I cannot name.

Forever, I will be searching for a new way to look,
For that thing, because, it is new,

I really do not know how to look for it.

I see life as a paradox, folding in on itself,
from the time we are born, til the time we are dead.

Life, is a mystery and we all must fulfill it to the most.

Today, I look for something, something new, something old,
hopefully something I can use.

I look for something</p>
